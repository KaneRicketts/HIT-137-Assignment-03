Question 1

Create a Tkinter application using the concepts of object-oriented
programming, such as, multiple inheritance, multiple decorators,
encapsulation, polymorphism, and method overriding, etc.
Wherever you use these concepts in code, explain them using # (How they are
linked to code).
Examples:
• Youtube Like Interface Applications.
• Using single/multiple Open-Source AI models (smaller) to a create
desktop application. Ex: An Image classification application, Language
translation app, object detection app, facial recognition app, etc.

(You just need to download the models and add its input points to the
buttons in your tkinter application. Whatever the user enters into the
application should go the AI model and give a output on the
application.)


Instructions:
Decide on an application.

Create a Tkinter application.

Use concepts of object-oriented
programming, such as, multiple inheritance, multiple decorators,
encapsulation, polymorphism, and method overriding, etc, in the application chosen.

Use an existing single/multiple Open-Source AI models (smaller) to a create the 
desktop application.

Download any relevant models or libraries and add its input points to the
buttons in your tkinter application. 
-  Whatever the user enters into the application should go the AI 
    model and give an output on the application.
