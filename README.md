Question 2
Create a simple “side-scrolling” 2D game using Pygame. 

The game should allow the player to control a character 
with the ability to run, jump, shoot projectiles. 
The game should have enemies, collectibles, and 3 levels. 
It should also have a scoring system, health, and lives.
The game should include the following, but not limited to:

• Player class (movements, speed, jump, health, lives) - Methods
• Enemy Class (……………….) – Methods

• Projectile Class (movements, speed, damage) – Methods
• Collectible Class (health boost, extra life, etc.,)

• Level Design (3 Levels), Add boss enemy at the end.

• A Scoring system based on enemies defeated, and collectibles
  collected, health bar for players, and enemies.

• Implement a game over screen with the option to restart.

Bonus: Create a dynamic camera that follows the players smoothly.

You have three game ideas, select one and implement the above
requirements:

• A game with human-like characters (hero, enemy)
• A game with an animal (Hero) and human characters (Enemy)
• A tank-based game navigating through a battlefield to engage with
enemy tanks or something


Steps required:

1) Choose the game idea.
2) Decide on character(s)? Options? Or just one?
3) Decide on character class specs:
4) Decide on projectile class specs:
5) Character life bar? Lives/Health? (3 lives, 100% health? - carried through whole game? per level?).
6) Determine enemy type(s) based on above game idea.
7) Decide on enemy(ies) class specs:
8) Decide on enemy(ies) (toxicity/weapon/projectile?) class specs:
9) Enemy life bar? Health? (no lives).
10) Determine collectible(s) suitable for game idea.
11) Decide on collectible(s) class specs:
12) Determine length of 3 levels.
13) Determine contents of each levels.
14) Decide on number of enemies per level:
15) Decide on type of enemy (combined? level 2 enemies + level 1 enemies? Or isolated, i.e. all same on one level, then new for next?).
16) Decide on level structure(s): (World view? Platform/Floor-Level/Cloud?)  (Obstacles? Jump/Crouch?).
17) Decide on passive enemy objects: (Cactus/Toxic-Spore-Cloud?)  (Stairway/Fall/Ground-Disruption/Distrubance?).
18) Determine boss level? Or incorporate into level 3?
19) Determine boss enemy type.
20) Decide on boss enemy class specs:
21) Decide on boss enemy (toxicity/weapon/projectile?) class specs:
22) Boss enemy life bar? Lives/Health? (2 lives, 100% Health?).
23) Determine difficulty (easy/medium/hard?).
24) Determine scoring based on level difficulty selection, enemies defeated and enemies remaining (jumped over, bypassed etc), collectibles
    collected, health and lives remaining for players, total time taken to complete game taking into account enemies remaining;
    i.e. if skipped enemies, faster, but lose marks to make ?unviable?.
25) Game start screen with Option to Start, Option to Exit, Option to Change character? (Colour, Shape, Name?), Option to Change Difficulty?
26) Game Over screen: Option to relpay/restart, Option to Exit, Player score?, High score record for session?.
27) Create a dynamic camera/screen (character always centred?) that follows the players smoothly.
