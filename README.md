Question 1

Create a Tkinter application using the concepts of object-oriented programming, such as, multiple inheritance, multiple decorators, encapsulation, polymorphism, and method overriding, etc. Wherever you use these concepts in code, explain them using # (How they are linked to code). Examples: • Youtube Like Interface Applications. • Using single/multiple Open-Source AI models (smaller) to a create desktop application. Ex: An Image classification application, Language translation app, object detection app, facial recognition app, etc. (You just need to download the models and add its input points to the buttons in your tkinter application. Whatever the user enters into the application should go the AI model and give a output on the application.)
